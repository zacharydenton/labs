<p>Langtonâ€™s Ant is a 4-state two-dimensional Turing machine invented in the 1980s. The ant starts out on a grid containing black and white cells, and then follows the following set of rules.</p>
<ol>
	<li>If the ant is on a black square, it turns right 90 degrees and moves forward one unit.</li>
	<li>If the ant is on a white square, it turns left 90 degrees and moves forward one unit.</li>
	<li>When the ant leaves a square, it inverts the color.</li>
</ol>
