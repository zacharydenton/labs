<p><em>Rainbow Spirograph</em> is a processing.js sketch inspired by the Spirograph toy. Instead of rotating a gear with
a pencil, this sketch simulates multicolored particles orbiting around a planet. Their paths
produce the colorful result you see above. Reload the page - itâ€™s different every time.</p>
