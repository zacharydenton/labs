<p>This is the cellular automaton known as <em>Conquest</em>, or b1/s12. Itâ€™s one of my favorite examples of
emergent complexity. Watch the patterns emerging. These are the rules that create the pattern:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If a dead cell has exactly one neighbor, it becomes alive.</li>
	<li>If a living cell has either one or two neighbors, it continues to live.</li>
	<li>Otherwise, the cell dies.</li>
</ul>
