<canvas data-processing-sources="spirosketch.pde"></canvas>

<p><em>Spirosketch</em> is very similar to <a href="../rainbow-spirograph">Rainbow Spirograph</a>. In fact, the only difference
is that the “planet” is now your mouse instead of the center of the canvas. It’s like drawing with 30 colored
pencils at the same time.</p>
